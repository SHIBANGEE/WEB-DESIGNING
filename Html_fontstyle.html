<h1>Friendship is a divine relationship. We don’t have similarities in our blood, but still, that person cares for us. Irrespective of all differences, a friend chooses you, understands you, and supports you. Whenever you are in self-doubt or lacking confidence, talk to a friend, and your worry will surely go away. A true friend will always want your happiness. A life without a good friend is merely empty. Honesty is the key factor to maintain the friendship forever. For understanding each other’s emotions, you have to be completely honest with each other. Patience and acceptance are also other factors for friendship to last long. Understanding the differences as well as accepting them is a maturity factor in a friendship. Friendship will fulfill you with sweet memories that you can cherish for the rest of your life. The unbounded love, as well as care, is what makes the relationship between two friends strong.</h1>
